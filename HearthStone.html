          Genre(s): Digital Collectible Card Game</br></br></br>
          <strong>Description:</strong></br></br>
          The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents,
          using constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected 
          hero with a unique power. Players use their limited mana 
          crystals to play abilities or summon minions to attack the 
          opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero. 
          Winning matches and completing quests earn in-game gold, 
          rewards in the form of new cards, and other in-game prizes. 
          Players can then buy packs of new cards through gold or 
          microtransactions to customize and improve their decks. 
          The game features several modes of play, including casual and 
          ranked matches, drafted arena battles, and single-player 
          adventures. New content for the game involves the addition of 
          new card sets and gameplay, taking the form of either expansion 
          packs or adventures that reward the player with collectible cards 
          upon completion.</br></br></br>
