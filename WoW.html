              Type: Game</br></br>
              Release Date: November 23 2004</br></br>
              Genre(s): Massively multiplayer, 
              online, 
              role-playing game</br></br></br>
              <strong>Description:</strong></br></br>
              Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players 
              to create a character avatar and explore an open 
              game world in third- or first-person view, exploring 
              the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing 
              quests, and interacting with non-player characters 
              (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players 
              to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons 
              and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat, however 
              the game can also be played solo without interacting 
              with others. The game primarily focuses on character 
              progression, in which players earn experience points 
              to level up their character to make them more powerful 
              and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire 
              better equipment, among other game systems.</br> World of 
              Warcraft was a major critical and commercial success upon 
              its original release in 2004 and quickly became the most 
              popular MMORPG of all time, reaching a peak of 12 million 
              subscribers in 2010.[4] The game had over one hundred 
              million registered accounts by 2014[5] and by 2017, had 
              grossed over $9.23 billion in revenue, making it one of 
              the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. 
              The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the 
              greatest MMORPG of all time and one of the greatest video 
              games of all time and has also been noted for its long 
              lifespan, continuing to receive developer support and 
              expansion packs over 15 years since its initial release.
